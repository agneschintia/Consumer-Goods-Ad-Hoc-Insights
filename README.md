#### Project Objective
Atliq Hardwares , a fictional company,  is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts to get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. As a data analytics director, Tony Sharma wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. He plans to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both tech and soft skills.

#### Tools
I created SQL queries by using MySQL. Practicing concepts like CTEs, Multiple Joins, Subqueries, Aggregate Function, and Window Function has prepared me to turn raw data into actionable insights.
